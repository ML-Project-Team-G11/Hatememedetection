***The base model along with the results is uploaded here.

The objective is to predict movie ratings based on three types of data: image(posters), text(synopses), and others (genre, director, etc). 
Multiple regression algorithms are used, from linear regressions to random forest, boosting, and SVR. Neural networks like CNN and RNN(LSTM) are also used to combine the three types of data. 
Classification methods are also discussed. 

The original dataset came from: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster.
